Unfortunately I won't be able to attend, but I have two papers published in the European Signal Processing conference that will be presented by Prof. Fabio Antonacci: [_Interpreting End-to-End Deep Learning Models for Speech Source Localization Using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03436) and [_Room transfer function reconstruction using complex-valued neural networks and irregularly distributed microphones_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04866) (led by [Francesca Ronchini](https://www.deib.polimi.it/ita/personale/dettagli/1898080)).
