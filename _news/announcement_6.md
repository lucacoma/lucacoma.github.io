I am super happy to announce that our paper *Diffused Responsibility: Analyzing the Energy Consumption of Generative Text-to-Audio Diffusion Models* ([Riccardo Passoni](https://github.com/rickgiantsteps), [Francesca Ronchini](https://github.com/RonFrancesca), Romain Serizel, Fabio Antonacci) has been accepted at [WASPAA 2025](https://waspaa.com)!!!

In this paper, we apply Pareto analysis to examine the environmental impact of the use of TextToAudio models! 

here you can find the preprint of the paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07615](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07615)!
