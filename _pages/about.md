I received the B.S. degree in Music Information Science from the [University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it/en), Milan, Italy, in 2014, the M.S. degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2018 and the Ph.D. (cum laude) in Information Engineering in 2022, both from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en), Milan, Italy,  where I am currently working as a temporary assistant professor (Ricercatore a Tempo Determinato di tipo A) as part of the [Image and Sound Processing Lab](http://ispl.deib.polimi.it/) within the [Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB)](https://www.deib.polimi.it/eng/home-page). I have been research assistant for the [INTERMUSIC](http://intermusicproject.eu/) project and I am currently part of the [(REPERTORIUM)](https://repertorium.eu/) project. Since 2018 I have been teaching assistant in the [M.Sc. in Music and Acoustic Engineering](https://www.polimi.it/en/international-prospective-students/laurea-magistrale-programmes-equivalent-to-master-of-science/programme-catalogue/music-and-acoustic-engineering) at Politecnico di Milano, for courses related to [musical acoustics](https://www4.ceda.polimi.it/manifesti/manifesti/controller/ManifestoPublic.do?EVN_DETTAGLIO_RIGA_MANIFESTO=EVENTO&c_insegn=051483&aa=2018&k_cf=225&k_corso_la=474&ac_ins=0&k_indir=Z2M&lang=EN&tipoCorso=ALL_TIPO_CORSO&semestre=1&idItemOfferta=135454&idRiga=225857&codDescr=051483) and [creative programming](https://mae-creative-pc.github.io/). I have been part of the organizing committee of [ISMIR 2023](https://ismir2023.ismir.net) as a member of the tech team. 

My main research interests concern the application of generative models to music informatics, space-time audio signal problems, and the development of techniques for human-computer interaction in musical contexts.
